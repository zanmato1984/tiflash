# Overall Work Objectives

- Deliver TiForth as an independent Arrow-native compute library (standalone repo `zanmato1984/tiforth`, consumed by TiFlash via FetchContent / local `libs/tiforth` checkout) with stable host APIs (Engine/Pipeline/Task), Arrow compute integration, and a minimal C ABI surface.
- Integrate TiForth into TiFlash behind `TIFLASH_ENABLE_TIFORTH` with Block<->Arrow bridging, DAG->pipeline translation, and gtests covering a common TiFlash DAG shape.
- Preserve TiFlash/TiDB semantics via a clear logical-type contract (Arrow field metadata) for tricky types (decimals, packed MyTime temporals, collated strings: compare/hash/sort keys).
- Route TiForth allocations through host-provided `arrow::MemoryPool` to support accounting/limits/spill hooks.

# Completed

- TiForth baseline (MS1-13, 2026-01-19): delivered standalone `tiforth` library (Engine/Pipeline/Plan/Task + C ABI skeleton), core operators (projection/filter/hash agg/join/sort) with breaker plan semantics and blocked-state model, Arrow logical-type metadata contract (decimal/MyTime/collations) and custom kernels for TiDB/TiFlash semantics, and TiFlash integration behind `TIFLASH_ENABLE_TIFORTH` (Block<->Arrow bridge + DAG→pipeline translation + parity gtests). Key decision: keep TiForth independent (no TiFlash assumptions) while matching Arrow coding style + rigid checks. Notes: full aggregation core includes TiFlash-shaped method selection + optimized hash tables. 
- MS14 Arrow-compute agg + benchmarks (2026-01-19): implemented TiForth `ArrowComputeAggTransformOp` via Arrow Acero (streaming input; supports compiled expressions via pre-projection; outputs reordered aggs-then-keys) and added TiFlash `bench_dbms` coverage + markdown report + string-key profiling. Found performance profile: numeric keys often faster than Native; string keys slow on raw varbinary but fast with shared-dictionary keys; Arrow cannot unify differing dictionaries across batches. Flamegraph root cause: Arrow grouper hot path on string keys is `GrouperFastImpl` + `SwissTable` with heavy varlen hashing (`HashVarLenImp`) and varbinary compares (`KeyCompare::CompareVarBinaryColumnToRowHelper` + memmove/memcpy); dict keys remove varbinary compare.

- TiFlash Arrow-compute agg A/B switch (2026-01-19): added runtime setting `enable_tiforth_arrow_compute_agg`, wired it into the TiFlash-shaped DAG→TiForth pipeline translation test harness to toggle `HashAggTransformOp` vs `ArrowComputeAggTransformOp`, and added a parity gtest for group-by sum (setting flipped on). Validation: `gtests_dbms` + targeted filters pass; branch pushed to `ruoxi/tiforth`. Files: `dbms/src/Interpreters/Settings.h`, `dbms/src/Flash/tests/gtest_tiforth_filter_agg_parity.cpp`, `dbms/src/Flash/tests/gtest_tiforth_pipeline_translate.cpp`, `.codex/progress/daemon.md`.
- TiFlash stream executor wiring (2026-01-19): enabled `enable_tiforth_arrow_compute_agg` for real TiFlash stream execution when `enable_tiforth_executor=1` by injecting a TiForth-backed aggregation stream in `PhysicalAggregation` (uses ArrowComputeAgg for non-string group keys; falls back to TiForth HashAgg on string group keys; safe fallback to native agg for unsupported shapes/collation-sensitive keys). Updated TiForth executor gate to allow non-pass-through DAGs only when opt-in flag is set; added gtests for int64 group-by sum and string-key HashAgg fallback. Files: `dbms/src/Flash/Planner/Plans/PhysicalAggregation.cpp`, `dbms/src/Flash/executeQuery.cpp`, `dbms/src/Flash/TiForth/TiForthAggBlockInputStream.{h,cpp}`, `dbms/src/Flash/tests/gtest_tiforth_query_executor_passthrough.cpp`, `.codex/progress/daemon.md`. Notes: current implementation buffers all input blocks for aggregation; no spill/IO blocked states wired yet.
- String-key perf decision (2026-01-19): keep ArrowComputeAgg for non-string group keys; for string group keys default to TiForth HashAgg (Arrow varlen key path too costly; dictionary keys fast only when dictionary is stable across batches, and Arrow doesn't unify dictionaries). Keep dict-key aggregation as benchmark-only for now; revisit when we can unify dictionaries or add an explicit “build stable dictionary then aggregate” mode. Files: `dbms/src/Interpreters/Settings.h`, `.codex/progress/daemon.md`.
- TiFlash vs Arrow string-key analysis (2026-01-19): documented why TiFlash native string hash agg outperforms Arrow/Acero for short string keys: `StringHashTable` encodes <=24B keys as fixed-width `StringKey8/16/24` (fast hash+equality) and uses saved-hash for long `StringRef`, while Arrow `GrouperFastImpl` always pays varlen hashing + row-table varbinary compares.
